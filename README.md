This is a program that people can use to get notifications for posts in Facebook sale groups.
Users enter the names of the item(s) they want to buy. This app uses the Facebook API to retrieve posts in a specified sale group, and searches for the given terms in the posts. Posts that contain the item(s) users want to buy are shown to the users when the search finishes.

TO DO (highest to lowest priority):
- Fix bug related to retrieving posts (!!!)
- Add refresh feature
